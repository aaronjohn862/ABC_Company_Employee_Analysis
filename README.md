# ABC Company Employee Analysis

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing employee data from ABC Company using Python. The objective is to preprocess the dataset, perform detailed data analysis, visualize results, and derive meaningful insights related to employees across different teams and positions.

## Dataset Information
- Total Rows: 458
- Total Columns: 9
- Source: Google Sheets (provided by the company)

## Preprocessing
- The Height column contained inconsistent values.
- It was corrected by replacing all values with random numbers between 150 and 180 to maintain data consistency and integrity.

## Analysis Tasks
1. Analyzed the distribution of employees across each team and calculated the percentage split.
2. Segregated employees based on their positions within the company.
3. Identified the predominant age group among employees.
4. Determined which team and position have the highest salary expenditure.
5. Analyzed the correlation between employee age and salary.

## Graphical Representation
- Bar charts were used for team-wise and position-wise employee distribution.
- Bar charts were created for age group distribution.
- Salary expenditure was visualized using bar graphs.
- A scatter plot was used to show the correlation between age and salary.

## Insights Gained
- Employees are concentrated in specific teams.
- Certain positions dominate the organizational structure.
- Most employees belong to the 26–35 age group.
- Senior roles and core teams account for the highest salary expenditure.
- A positive correlation exists between age and salary, indicating that experience impacts earnings.

## Tools and Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Google Colab
